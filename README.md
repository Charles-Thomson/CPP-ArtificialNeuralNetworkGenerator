Neural Network Training Pipeline

Overview

This project is a C++ implementation of a pipeline for creating and training artificial neural networks. Built using CMake, the project aims to provide a structured workflow for defining, generating, and training neural networks efficiently.

Features

JSON Parser: Parses configuration files for defining neural network architectures and training parameters.

Generation Pipeline: Handles the structured creation of neural networks based on user-defined configurations.

Training Pipeline: Implements the training mechanism for optimizing neural network performance.

Prerequisites

To build and run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

C++ Compiler (C++17 or later recommended)

CMake (version 3.10 or later)

Roadmap

Future improvements and features include:

Implementing different activation functions

Expanding training strategies (SGD, Adam, etc.)

Introducing GPU acceleration

Support for saving/loading trained models

Enhancing the CPP-JSONParser to cover more complex use cases
