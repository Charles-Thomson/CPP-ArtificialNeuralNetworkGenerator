Neural Network Training Pipeline
Overview
This project provides a C++ implementation of a modular pipeline for creating and training artificial neural networks (ANNs). Built using CMake, it offers a structured and extensible workflow to define architectures, configure parameters, and run training processes efficiently.

Features
JSON Configuration Parser
Easily define neural network architectures and training parameters using JSON configuration files.

Network Generation Pipeline
Automatically generates neural networks based on the user-defined configuration files.

Training Pipeline
Includes core training logic and optimization routines to improve neural network performance.

Prerequisites
Before building the project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

A C++ compiler that supports C++17 or later

CMake version 3.10 or higher
